            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond"><b>Solo:</b> You must start a new lvl.1 character. The entire game must be played alone.</p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond"><b>No New Game:</b> You cannot restart a new game to make monsters re-spawn, farm XP and shrines.</p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond"><b>No Escape:</b> As soon as you enter the dungeon, you can't go back. There are a few exceptions to this rule: (i) when you finish a chapter and open the shortcut to town. You can only return to town once per chapter transition (using this method); (ii) using a scroll of town portal that you dropped in the dungeon.</p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond">This includes quests. If you want to collect reward from quests, either wait for the next chapter or use a TP.</p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond">You cannot cast town portals from memory, after learning it in a book OR from staffs.</p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond"><b>Backtracking:</b> You can backtrack in order to kill bosses or monsters you skipped.</p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond">You cannot backtrack to pickup loot you left in previous floors. Pretend everything you left behind when you leave a floor is stolen by goblins.</p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond">You can still pick up things you just dropped when backtracking.</p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond">You can leave things in town. Cain is watching over your stuff !</p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond"><b>"Live of the Land":</b> You are not allowed to bring consumable items from town to the dungeon. You may purchase scrolls and potions, but they must be used *before* leaving Tristan.</p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond">This is the only rule regarding NPCs services. You can repair equipment and recharge staffs, you can purchase books and equipment, you can patch yourself in Pepin and ask Cain to identify your items.</p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond">Since Cain can identify items, Pepin heals you for free and there is no use for TPs, the only use for consumable is to restore Mana on Adria. This slightly more complicated rule was made in order to keep the mod viable for sorcerers.</p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond"><b>Hardcore:</b> If you die you lose the challenge.</p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond"><b>You win if you kill Diablo and beat the game. Congrats !</b></p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond"><b>Purist:</b> All stuff you carry most be found by your char, you can't trade.'</p>
            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond"><b>Fuck the NPCs:</b> You cant talk to NPC even pepin to heal.</p>

            <h2><font face="exocetheavy">Purist</h2>
            <h3><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond"><b>Tag: TLP_</b></h3>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond">Purists are players who choose to eschew some elements of the game, usually ones that make things easier, with the aim of creating a more challenging gaming experience, or at least not cheating.</p>


            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond">They may avoid common forms of cheating, cheesy techniques, or even regulation elements of the game.</p>

            <p><font face="Bookman Old Style, Book Antiqua, Garamond">Some purists refuse to trade items, twink, maphack, or mule items. In some cases or they may only play LotL style, or only use low level skills, etc. There are countless ways for players to remain pure, and it's not uncommon for players to keep some of their characters pure, while playing less scrupulously with others.</p>

            <h2>Diablo 2 Classes</h2>
            <h3><b>Tag : TLA_, TLB_, TLP_, TLN_, TLS_</b></h3>

            <p>Class: Rogue,Warrior and sorcerer</p>
            <p>Amazon=Rogue</p>
            <p>Necromancer /Sorceress =Sorcerer</p>
            <p>Barbarian /Paladin =Warrior</p>

            <p><b>Ammazons : TLA</b>can learn Lightning (Lightning Bolt), Chain Lightning (Lightning Strike/Fury), Charged Bolt (Charged Strike), Golem (Valkyrie), Stone Curse (Freezing Arrow), Bone Spirit (Guided Arrow), Fire Ball (Exploding Arrow), Fire Bolt (Fire Arrow), Fire Wall (Immolation Arrow), Blood Star (Magic Arrow). </p>
            <p><b>Barbarians : TLB</b>can learn and cast Teleport (Leap/Leap Attack), Stone Curse (Stun), slvl 1 Elemental/BSpirit (Taunt), Find Potion (Healing/Heal Other), Mana Shield (Battle Orders). Barbarians can also cast Apocalypse (War Cry). Barbarians may not Leap/Leap Attack over walls.</p>
            <p><b>Paladins : TLP</b>can learn and cast Charged Bolt (FoH), Stone Curse (Vengeance/Charge/Holy Freeze), Blood Star (Sacrifice), Mana Shield (Holy Shield), Flame Wave (Holy Fire), Holy Bolt (Duh...), Healing (Redemption), Heal Other (Prayer). [Sorry, folks, there's just no spell crappy enough to take the place of Holy Shock. And Charged Bolt is pushing it as a replacement for Fist of the Heavens.] </p>
            <p><b>Necromancers : TLN</b>can learn and cast Bone Spirit (Duh), Charged Bolt (Teeth), Mana Shield (Bone Armor), Elemental (Fire Golem), Golem (Clay Golem), Lightning (Bone Spear), Stone Curse (Bone Prison), Fire Wall (Bone Wall + Iron Maiden), Skeleton Mage (Guardian). Fire Bolt may be learned (but not cast) for Guardian purposes. Fire Bolt learned by the Necromancer in this way does not count as a spell learned for a character level. Necro's Mana Shield/Bone Armor is not like that of other spell casters. The Necro may not drink Mana/Rejuv potions while Mana Shield is active. [It's too easy otherwise.] </p>
            <p><b>Sorceress : TLS</b>can learn and cast Fire Bolt, Inferno, Fire Ball, Fire Wall, Guardian (Hydra), Charged Bolt, Flash (Static Field), Telekinesis, Lightning, Chain Lightning, Teleport, Mana Shield (Energy Shield), Stone Curse (Ice Blast). She may also cast Nova. The Sorceress, too, must follow the Necromancer's Mana Shield restriction. </p>
